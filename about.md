This application was developed for the Final project of the **Coursera Data Science Capstone Course**. 
The assignment was to build a shiny app with a predictive text model that provides the next word as the user types a 
sentence (i.e. Swiftkey technology).

### Steps
1. When the application starts, **"NULL"** will be displayed at the Next Predicted Word textbox.
2. The user needs to enter a partially complete sentence to begin the next word prediction.


### Results
1. Next word predicted is shown at the Predicted Next Word textbox.
2. Information on the n-gram backoff algorithm used to predict is shown as indication.

#### Note:
The source codes for ui.R and server.R files are also available on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/arpadthetall/capstone)

Presentation Slide decks are available on the [RPubs page](http://rpubs.com/arpadthetall/capstone)
